              <p>
MIAOW (pronounced me-ow) is an open source GPU created by the Vertical 
Research Group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison led by Professor 
Karu Sankaralingam. Based off of the publicly released Southern Islands 
ISA by AMD, MIAOW implements a compute unit suitable for performing 
architecture analysis and experimentation with GPGPU workloads. In 
addition to the Verilog HDL composing the compute unit, MIAOW also 
includes a suite of unit tests and benchmarks for regression testing.</p>

<p>A primary motivator for MIAOW's creation is the belief that software 
simulators of hardware such as CPUs and GPUs often miss many subtle 
aspects that can skew the performance, power, and other quantitative 
results that they produce. As an actual implementation of a GPU's logic,
 the Vertical Research Group believes that MIAOW can be a useful tool in
 producing not only more accurate quantitative results when benchmarking
 GPGPU workloads but also provide context for the architectural 
complexities of actually implementing newly proposed algorithms and 
designs that are intended to improve performance or other desired 
characteristics.</p>

<p>Our long term vision is to move forward the movement of Open Source 
Hardware by contributing an open source GPU implementation to it.</p>

<p>It must be emphasized that MIAOW represents a GPU's compute unit. It 
does not possess the auxiliary logic required to produce actual 
graphical output nor does it have logic to connect it to a specific 
memory interface or system bus. These extensions can be developed and we
 would welcome outside contributors for such efforts, but as MIAOW was 
created as a research tool their presence was not an absolute necessity 
in running benchmarks and experiments.</p>

<p>MIAOW's RTL and detailed documetation are on Github. A short whitepaper that decsribes MIAOW and its usage in research is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/VerticalResearchGroup/miaow/files/MIAOW_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf">here</a></p>
