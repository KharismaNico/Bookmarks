<h1>Why it is important not to have children.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing you can do,  avoid global heating disaster and
make a positive contribution to the world,
is <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/culture/if-you-really-want-help-planet-dont-have-another-kid.html">avoid
having children</a>.  The numbers, which were calculated for America
today, say that having a child equals roughly 36 round-trip
transatlantic flights per year.</p>

<p>In what sense "per year"?  That carbon burden of having a child is
incurred as a lump sum by reproducing, not gradually over time.  The
authors of the study divided that lump sum by the average life
expectancy, which they took to be 80 years.  It would be clearer to
think of it as
  <a href="http://www.kimnicholas.com/uploads/2/5/7/6/25766487/faqs__2_.pdf">2880 round-trip transatlantic flights</a> total.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I decided not to have children for other reasons.  When I was
young, my family was full of tension and anger, and then I noticed
that many others were too.  Such a family life was in no way
attractive.  When older, often I saw parents rebuke their children for
playing with me, or even in my vicinity, assuming it would bother me
— without waiting to see if I objected.  Rebuking those children
had become an ingrained, automatic habit.  To see this made me sad for
them, but I knew I would be the same as a parent.  I would not be able
to cope with a frequently crying baby without becoming upset and
angry.</p>

<p>Of course, many people tell themselves, "That happens to others,
but I am better than they; I will get it right."  Obviously, most of
them are mistaken.  I did not suppose that I would succeed in human
relationships where most people fail.</p>

<p>Most fathers in the US have to work very hard to get money for
their children.  I did not want a life of running on a treadmill,
doing whatever people with money would tell me to do.</p>

<p>A large fraction of US fathers eventually get divorced, and
subsequently rarely see the children for whom they are spending most
of their time scrabbling for money.  What a futile life!  But even
those who are not yet divorced see their children little, since they
are so busy at work.</p>

<p>I am convinced I made a wise personal decision in avoiding this.
But I was not the only one that benefited from it — everyone did.
Not having children is an important contribution to humanity.  My
decision probably reduced the 2050 population by 5 to 10 people.</p>

<p>Overpopulation is a tremendous danger to civilization and the
ecosphere.  It makes every human-caused ecological problem bigger.
Population growth has slowed but not stopped.  The human population is
expected to grow by 2 or 3 billion by 2050, and it is not clear how to
find water and food for all those people.  Population growth also
increases the difficulty of curbing global heating.

</p><p>Thus, the decision about having children is, for most people, the
most important decision in their lives about how they will affect
humanity's resource footprint in the future.  (Nina Paley said this
brilliantly
in <a href="http://archive.org/14/items/NinaVision/The_Stork.ogv">
graphical form</a>.)</p>

<p>My decision was a contribution in itself, and it enabled me to make
a further contribution: to
launch <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html"> GNU</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">
the free software movement</a>.  Having no dependents, I could
dedicate myself to what seemed right rather than to whatever someone
with money told me to do.  If you are reading this page, it is because
that decision enabled me to make contributions to humanity that people
appreciate.</p>

<p>I therefore urge you to do as I have done, and have no children.</p>

<p>I don't wish that nobody had any children; I don't want humanity to
disappear.  But there is no risk of that; no chance that my influence
could be so great as to reduce the birth rate to near zero.  Given the
numbers I am likely to influence, the influence is all to the good.</p>

<p>Some argue that population decline is the real danger.  In 50
years, they claim, everyone will have a comfortable life, so they may
have few children (as tends to happen in developed societies today),
and the human population could decline.  If this went on for millenia,
humanity might disappear.  Is that a real possibility?</p>

<p>First of all, it disregards the tremendous disaster that global
heating and destruction of the natural world are leading towards.  30
years from now, large parts of humanity will probably find it hard to
get water or food, let alone contraception.  It is unlikely we will
provide most of humanity with a decent European-style life with the
current world population.  So there is little chance, in that world,
of population decrease because everyone is comfortable.</p>

<p>Supposing we avoid the disaster and eliminate poverty, 50 years
later we might reach a stage where everyone prefers a small family.
However, 50 years after that we will probably have greatly extended
the human life span.  That means a much smaller number of births per
adult per year would be enough to maintain a stable population.  The
danger of overpopulation might even return.</p>

<p>The first hurdle is to avoid the disaster.  Having no children will
help, and it will free you to do something else that will help.</p>

<h3>Environmental Reasons</h3>
<ul>

  <li>
      <a href="http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2011/08/16/i-population-problem-0">"I
	decided not to have children for environmental reasons"</a>.
    <p>
      Especially the well-off Americans, who consume so much per person,
      should have fewer children.
  </p></li>

  <li>
    A study confirms: the biggest thing you can do to reduce global
    heating is to
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">have
      fewer children</a>.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Natalist Pressure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The singing star Adele said she was pushed to have children by
      pervasive social pressure, and said that
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/nov/02/if-even-adele-feels-inadequate-what-hope-is-there-for-the-rest-of-us">"it's
	the bravest thing not to have a child"</a>.</p>
    <p>
      You can help women resist this pressure, by speaking up when you see
      others create this pressure.  You can also say, "Having children is
      selfish.  If you don't have children, you can dedicate your time to
      something that the world really needs."
  </p></li>

  <li>
    <a href="http://www.art.net/studios/hackers/hopkins/Don/text/rms-vs-doctor.html">
      The discussion that ensued</a> in 1993 when I criticized the posting of
    a birth announcement on a list where it was off-topic.

</ul>

<h3>Well being of the children</h3>

  </li>

    <li>
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/06/how-extinction-rebellion-put-world-on-red-alert-year-since-it-was-founded">Extinction Rebellion activist</a>:
 "I'm scared of my own future.  How could anyone think about having kids
 now?  It's not even just about the carbon footprint and population 
growth … What kind of world are you thinking they're going to live in?"
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Well-being of parents</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Having a child causes the mother <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/26/parenthood-sleep-deprivation-after-birth-mothers-hit-hardest-research">sleep deprivation for up to 6
    years</a>.
  <p>
    Having a baby causes one's DNA
    to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/27/pregnancy-is-a-life-experience-id-rather-avoid-that-doesnt-mean-im-selfish">age
      by several years</a>.
  </p></li>

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/marriage-kids-children-relationship-suffers-research">
      Want to Save Your Marriage</a> (or non-married long-term
      relationship)?  Don't Have Kids.
    <p>
      Apparently children are bad for lots of people's relationships, but
      most people are not realistic enough to think about this risk
      until it is too late.
    </p><p>
      Women in the US and Europe are starting to
      <a href="http://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a22189/i-regret-having-kids/">
      admit that they regret having had children</a>.
    </p><p>
      "I used to think I was
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/24/children-parenting-anger">calm
      and in control</a>. Then I had children."
  </p></li>

  <li>
      In a world with no shortage of babies, there is nothing
      altruistic about reproducing — rather, it is an indirect
      form of selfishness.
    <p>
      If you want to bring up a child as an act of benevolence, of
      altruism, adopt a child.  If you hesitate to make a 20-year
      commitment to do this, you could take in a foster child.
      That also helps children, but you can stop more easily
      if you find that necessary.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Many millenials are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/19/millennials-fur-babies-responsibility-pamper-pet">having pets</a> instead of babies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If that helps you avoid children, it is a good idea, but what's the
sense of paying someone else to keep company with your dog instead of
you?  It's like paying someone else to spend time with your friends
for you: it defeats the purpose of friendship, whether that be with a
human or with a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is absurd to pamper your dog expensively; that obsession makes for
stress and spoils the fun.  A dog will not live as long as a human,
and a dog's death is not the same loss as a human's death.
    </p>
  </li>


</ul>

<h3>Government Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>
    <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/Articles/~3/mVQrGujp_3g/the-10-worst-helicopter-parenting-moment">Governments are rapidly making it nearly impossible to take care of
    children</a>
    by requiring adults to watch them every minute of the day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Escaping from that idiocy is an additional benefit
    of not having children.
  </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>
  Rebecca Solnit's essay, <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/10/the-mother-of-all-questions/">"The Mother of All Questions"</a>, presents an
  overlapping set of reasons for not having children in the way I wish I
  could have written them.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
  Many
  women <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/12/sex-after-pregnancy-meaghan-oconnell-now-we-have-everything-extract">lose
  all sexual desire after they have a child</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
  People who have one child face
  <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/27/the-pressure-to-have-a-second-child-eva-wiseman">social
  pressure to have another</a>. But you can resist the pressure.
