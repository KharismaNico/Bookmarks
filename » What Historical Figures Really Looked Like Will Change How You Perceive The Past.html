                                        <p>We all have a general idea of
 what people like Julius Caesar and George Washington looked like. The 
images of these historical figures and more have been immortalized with 
the help of paintings, portraits, and sculptures made when they were 
still alive. But these works of art couldnât possibly have been that 
accurate and in some cases, artists were ordered to flatter whoever 
commissioned them. </p>
<p>Thanks to modern technology, weâve been able to find out what these 
people actually looked like. If you saw Julius Caesar today, you might 
not think he was the ruthless general we all know him to be. Read on to 
see what he and other famous figures really looked like!</p>

<h2>King Tut</h2>
<p>King Tutankhamun was an Egyptian pharaoh who reigned from 1332 to1323
 BC during Egyptâs New Kingdom era. Known simply as King Tut, the 
pharaoh ascended the throne when he was just around nine or ten years 
old. </p><div class="primary-ad-widget" id="primary-over-image"></div><div class="picture-container cf firstImageWrapper">

 Tutâs tomb was discovered in 1922 by British archaeologist Howard 
Carter. Sealed for more than 3,200 years, the tomb was completely 
intact, containing artifacts and treasures meant to accompany Tut in the
 afterlife. The young pharaoh only reigned for about ten years before he
 died and scientists discovered what contributed to Tutâs death after 
finding out what he looked like. </p>

<p>DNA studies of Tut's mummy indicate that he had a number of health 
problems that contributed to his death. Tut was a tall pharaoh but a 
frail one as well. Not only did he suffer from multiple bouts of 
malaria, but Tut also had a bone disorder and was revealed to have an 
infected broken leg at his death. </p>
<p>Evidence of a club foot also revealed the potential disadvantages of 
traditional inbreeding at the time (his mom and dad were brother and 
sister). These revelations shed more light on the life of King Tut, who 
is the only pharaoh pictured doing everything sitting down, including 
performing archery. </p>
