Graphics Architecture Studies
</h1>
</center>

<p>

The design of most graphics architectures involves quantitative study of
one or more aspects of the graphics pipeline.  We have carried out several
such studies and have developed a set of tools for making such studies
easier to perform.  We are currently working on generalizing the tools to
simulate a broader range of architectures.

</p><h3>
Studies
</h3>

<p>

To date, we have completed five studies:

</p><p>

A <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/studies/texture_compression">study on texture compression</a> looked at
the use of vector quantization techniques to allow texture memory to be
used more efficiently and concluded that compression ratios of up to 35:1
were possible with acceptable loss of image quality.  Vector quantization
is amenable to efficient hardware implementation.

</p><p>

A <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/studies/texture_cache">study on texture caching</a> examined locality of
reference with respect to texture accesses and explored the use of caches
to exploit this locality and reduce memory bandwidth requirements.  The
study concluded that the use of a texture cache could reduce texture memory
bandwidth requirements by three to fifteen times.

</p><p>

A <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/studies/texture_prefetch">study on texture prefetching</a> proposed a
specialized prefetching architecture for hiding the latency of texture
cache misses without introducing additional conflict misses.  A
cycle-accurate simulation showed that, even in a system with high memory
latencies, the architecture was over 97% efficient.

</p><p>

A <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/papers/bucket_render">study on overlap</a> revealed that
the impact of overlap in bucket rendering systems was limited in
scope, despite the observation that large triangles have large overlap
factors.  The paper concluded that, if current trends continue, the
efficient use of smaller and smaller tile sizes would be possible.

</p><p>

Finally, a <a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/papers/parallel_texture">study on parallel
texture caching</a> examined the efficiency of texture caching in a
variety of current and proposed parallel rasterization architectures.
We quantify inefficiencies due to redundant work, inherent parallel
load imbalance, insufficient memory bandwidth, and resource contention
and demonstrate that in general parallel texture caching works well.

</p><p>

In addition to the studies we have completed is an ongoing effort to
<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/studies/scenes">acquire and analyze scenes</a>.

</p><h3>
Tracing
</h3>

<p>

All of our most recent architectural studies have made use of command
stream traces gathered from real OpenGL applications.  Such a trace
captures all of the OpenGL functions calls made by an application, allowing
the entire graphics portion of the application to be replayed at a later
time.  Capturing and replaying a trace has two important advantages over
rerunning the original application:

</p><ol>

<li>

Traces are <em>consistent</em>.  Using a command stream trace removes the
possibility of rerunning the application with different inputs and
operating conditions for each run; this is especially true with interactive
applications.

</li><li>

Traces are <em>portable</em>.  A command stream trace can be captured on
one host machine and run on another, even if the hosts are of different
machine types; often, it can be difficult or impossible to run some
applications on more than a few host machine types.

<!--

<li>

Traces are <em>compact</em>.  A command stream trace is a single file,
while an application might consist of many different files; traces are
therefore simpler to store, manage, and distribute.

-->

</li></ol>

<p>

Capturing a trace imposes a small per-command overhead on the running
application.  Depending on the application, this overhead may or may not
have an effect on the commands stored in the trace.  Whether or not this
matters depends on what the trace is used for.  For most architectural
studies, the effect does not matter.

</p><h3>
Tools
</h3>

<p>

In order to collect our traces, we assembled a set of tools for capturing,
replaying, and analyzing command streams from real applications.  The tools are
currently center around two command stream file formats:

<a href="http://reality.sgi.com/dunwoody/glsspec.txt">GLS</a>,
a file format for storing streams of OpenGL commands, and
<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/frugl/tracing">FGLS</a>,
a similar file format for storing streams of FruGL commands.
<a href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/projects/flashg/frugl">FruGL</a>
is a light-weight graphics API based on OpenGL and used to interface to our
research rendering system.

</p><p>

<b>Figure 1</b> illustrates the tools we use and the flow of scene data
between them.

</p><p>

Most traces are gathered by running real OpenGL applications and tracing
them with <em>glstrace</em>, a utility written by Phil Lacroute of SGI.
The resulting GLS streams are then converted into FGLS streams using
<em>glstofgls</em>.  FGLS streams may also be gathered by tracing FruGL
applications; however, we rarely collect traces in this manner.

</p><p>

Once a command stream is in the FGLS format, it can be replayed using the
Argus rendering library, analyzed by a scene analyzer, or run through an
architectural simulator.

<h3>
Tools Revisited
</h3>

<p>

While the tool flow shown in <b>Figure 1</b> serves us well, particular
aspects were cumbersome enough to warrant the development of a second,
simpler set of tools.

</p><p>

Our new tracing tools store traces as GLT streams.  GLT streams are similar
to GLS streams in that both formats store streams of OpenGL commands;
however, the implementation details of GLT streams are such that we find
GLT streams to be more efficient and easier to use than GLS streams.
Moreover, because we developed GLT from scratch, we were able to port the
tracing software from IRIX to Windows NT, allowing us to collect traces on
both platforms.

</p><p>

<b>Figure 2</b> shows the data flow for our second generation of tools.

</p><p>

Using the new tools, traces may be gathered only by tracing OpenGL
applications.  Once in the GLT format, traces may be replayed using any
OpenGL rendering library.  In addition, traces may be analyzed using a
scene analyzer or studied with an architectural simulator.

<p>

Some parts of our rendering system are still based on FruGL and FGLS.
We support these parts of our rendering system using a tool, not shown
above, that converts GLT streams into FGLS streams in a manner similar
to <em>glstofgls</em>.

</p><p>

[Update: Our GLT tools are now in the public domain, and can be <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/software/glt/">downloaded</a>.]
