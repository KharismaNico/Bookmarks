</p><p class="body">
    
        I know it’s not what the cool kids like to do, but I like to read non-fiction. Lots of non-fiction. And my favorite moments reading non-fiction are when a book bitchslaps my brain and reconfigures my entire understanding of reality and my place within it.

I never know what the hell to say because so many of the <a href="https://markmanson.net/6-books">books that have influenced me</a> have done so not because they’re so good or brilliant, but mostly because they addressed the issues I was going through at the time I was reading them.

It doesn’t fit in with the rest because it basically tries to convince you that you don’t even know what the hell makes you happy in the first place, so why stress out about it?
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        Gilbert is a famous Harvard psychologist who has a knack for coming up with zany experiments that show just how <a href="https://markmanson.net/trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed and biased the human mind is</a>. In the book, he shows you time and again that as humans, we inaccurately judge, among other things, what made us happy in the past, what will make us happy in the future, and even what is <a href="https://markmanson.net/stop-trying-to-be-happy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making us happy right at this moment</a>.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        In fact, decades of Gilbert’s research on happiness all points to the same unsettling fact: happiness has little to do with what happens to us in our lives, and more to do with <a href="https://markmanson.net/happiness-not-enough" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how we end up choosing to see things</a>.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        Gilbert’s theory is that we each have a “psychological immune system,” basically a bullshit generator where our minds explain away our past experiences, our future projections and our current situations in such a way that we always maintain a baseline level of mild happiness.<a href="https://markmanson.net/7-books#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> And it’s when this “immune system” fails that we fall into prolonged depression and/or existential crises.
    
</p><p class="body"><strong>Notable Quotes:</strong></p><p class="body">
    
        “We treat our future selves as though they were our children, spending most of the hours of most of our days constructing tomorrows that we hope will make them happy… But our temporal progeny are often thankless. We toil and sweat to give them just what we think they will like, and they quit their jobs, grow their hair, move to or from San Francisco, and wonder how we could ever have been stupid enough to think they’d like that. We fail to achieve the accolades and rewards that we consider crucial to their well-being, and they end up thanking God that things didn’t work out according to our shortsighted, misguided plan.”
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        “Economies thrive when individuals strive, but because individuals will only strive for their own happiness, it is essential that they mistakenly believe that producing and consuming are routes to personal well-being.”
    
</p><p class="body"><strong>Bonus Points For:</strong> Being perhaps the wittiest and best-written psychology book you’ll ever read.
    
</p><p class="body"><strong>If This Book Could Be Summarized in An Image, That Image Would Be:</strong> A dog named “Humanity” endlessly chasing its own tail with a big slobbery smile on its face.
    
</p><p class="body"><strong>Read This Book If…</strong><br/>
…you enjoy Harvard professors who reference The Beatles in every chapter and make jokes about quadriplegics.  <br/>
…you are interested in behavioral economics and irrational decision-making.  <br/>
…you’ve always had a hunch that you are completely full of shit but would like 400 pages of psychological research to confirm it for you.  <br/>
…you want to read a book that <a href="https://markmanson.net/downloads/happiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains happiness</a> without mythologizing it or worshipping it.

In three essays totaling around 100 pages, he lays out the following:
    
</p><ol class="postList numlist both-indent1"><li class="graf graf--li">In any population, you are going to have a group of people who are more talented/gifted/intelligent than average. Let’s call them The Strong. You are also going to have a group of people who are less talented/gifted/intelligent than average. Let’s call them The Weak.<a href="https://markmanson.net/7-books#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a></li><li class="graf graf--li">The Strong will naturally accrue the power in society for no other reason than they are more capable and talented than the others.</li><li class="graf graf--li">Because The Strong won their greater power and influence through outsmarting or outperforming others, they will come to adopt ethical beliefs that justify their position: that might makes right, that they are entitled to their privileged position, <a href="https://markmanson.net/american-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that they earned what is theirs</a>. Nietzsche calls this “Master Morality.”</li><li class="graf graf--li">Because The Weak lost their power and influence by being outsmarted and outperformed, they will come to adopt ethical beliefs that justify their position: that people deserve aid and charity, that one should give away one’s possessions to the less fortunate, that you should live for others and not yourself. Nietzsche calls this “Slave Morality.”</li><li class="graf graf--li">Master/Slave Moralities have been in a kind of tension in every society for all of recorded history. Many political/social conflicts are side effects of the struggle between Master and Slave Moralities.</li><li class="graf graf--li">Nietzsche believed that the ideas of guilt, punishment and a “bad conscience” are all culturally constructed and used by The Weak to chip away at the dominance and power of The Strong. He also believed that Slave Morality is just as capable of corrupting and oppressing a society as Master Morality. He used Christianity as his primary example of this.</li><li class="graf graf--li">Nietzsche believed that Slave Morality stifled man’s greatest characteristics: creativity, innovation, ambition, and even happiness itself.</li></ol><p class="body"><strong>Notable Quotes:</strong></p><p class="body">

If he’s trolling the world with his writing style, he’s doing a good job, because some passages are almost impossible to get through without either rolling your eyes at him or shoving the book through a paper shredder. If he really is this arrogant, well, then let’s just say he won’t be invited to any of my playdates anytime soon.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        Taleb has a handful of amazing ideas. I’m talking potentially life-changing, world-affecting ideas. These ideas can be explained well in about 50 pages. The other 450 pages are mostly him trying to prove how cool and cultured he is while explaining how much smarter he is than the following groups of people: academics, politicians, Nobel Prize winners, Wall Street analysts, economists, journalists, statisticians, historians, soccer moms, teachers, anybody who uses the bell curve, anybody in the social sciences, and anyone who disagrees with him.

He had invented psychoanalysis, brought the science of psychology to the mainstream, and was highly regarded in intellectual circles around Europe. Then World War I broke out, and destroyed, well, just about everything. Freud was deeply moved by the devastation and fell into a deep depression and secluded himself for much of the 1920s. <a href="https://markmanson.net/%20http:/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393304515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0393304515&linkCode=as2&tag=entsblo-20&linkId=DXWHSYLZIGYNB33V" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i></a> was the result of this depression.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        The book makes one simple argument: that humans have deep, animalistic instincts to eat, kill, or fuck everything. Freud argued that civilization could only arise when enough humans learned to repress these deeper and baser urges, to push them into the unconscious where (according to his model) they would fester and ultimately generate all sorts of neuroses.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        Freud basically came to the conclusion that as humans, we had one of two shitty options in life: 1) repress all of our basic instincts to maintain some semblance of a safe and cooperative civilization, thus making ourselves <a href="https://markmanson.net/the-guide-to-being-miserable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miserable</a> and <a href="https://markmanson.net/benefits-of-being-slightly-crazy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurotic</a> or 2) to let them all out and let shit hit the fan.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        To Freud, Hitler and World War II just proved his point a few years later. And as an Austrian Jew, he ran for the hills. The hills being London, of course. He lived out the last years of his life in a city being bombed into oblivion.
    
</p><p class="body"><strong>Notable Quotes:</strong></p><p class="body">
    
        “It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built up upon a renunciation of instinct.”

        And the fucked up part is that some of his explanation of how this is going to happen makes sense. I mean, it’s probably not going to happen. And the book reads like it was written by a middle-aged engineer who took too much acid and now desperately needs to speak with a therapist. Kurzweil claims, among other things, that baby boomers are the first generation that will conquer aging and death, and that he wants to digitally transcribe his dead father’s brain into computer software so he can like, you know, Skype chat with good ol’ dad again.

</p><p class="body">
    
        Because man is the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own existence — thinking about his life, <a href="https://markmanson.net/the-meaning-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questioning it</a>, imagining future possibilities — man is therefore also the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own non-existence, i.e., his own death.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        In other words, humans were given the gift of being able to imagine the future and who we want to be, but the price we pay for this gift is the realization that we will one day die. A dog doesn’t realize she’s going to die. Neither does a fish. Or a roach. But we do.
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        This knowledge of our own inevitable death leads to a kind of ever-present “terror” that underlies everything we do. Becker argues that this terror inspires us all to take on what he calls a “hero project,” where we attempt to immortalize ourselves through our deeds and actions, to create something bigger than ourselves that will <a href="https://markmanson.net/four-stages-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live beyond our own lives.</a></p><p class="body">
    
        It’s when people’s hero projects contradict one another that we get conflict, violence, bigotry, and evil. It’s when hero projects fail that we fall into deep despair and depression because we’re once again confronted with the inevitability of our own death and <a href="https://markmanson.net/the-meaning-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meaninglessness of our lives</a>.<a href="https://markmanson.net/7-books#footnote-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p class="body"><strong>Notable Quotes:</strong></p><p class="body">
    
        “Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.”
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        “The irony of man’s condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which awakens it, and so we must shrink from being fully alive.”
    
</p><p class="body">
    
        “What does it mean to be a self-conscious animal? The idea is ludicrous, if it is not monstrous. It means to know that one is food for worms. This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression and with all this yet to die. It seems like a hoax, which is why one type of cultural man rebels openly against the idea of God. What kind of deity would create such a complex and fancy worm food?”
